# kubernetes-helper-scripts
A collection of scripts to help when setting up Kubernetes.  They are slanted for use by CABI but could be easily adapted.
To install or update the scripts, run the following command:
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git && rm -R -f helpers && git clone https://github.com/cabi-org/kubernetes-helper-scripts.git helpers && bash helpers/setup-helper-scripts.sh
```
